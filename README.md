## Abstract

This project involved several key statistical concepts, including hypothesis tests to validate or refute assumptions about the given dataset and the calculation of summary statistics, such as the mean and standard deviation. I created appropriate plots, like histograms, to visualize the data summary. Additionally, I conducted correlation analysis to explore the relationships between variables, using the Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify linear associations. Regression analysis was employed to model and predict data trends. All analyses and visualizations were completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python.
